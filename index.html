    <h1>Hey lovely,</h1>
    <h2>I hope you are well.</h2>
    <p>I was gonna write you a letter and send it to you this morning, but I woke up late lol. 
      So I decided I can just make you a virtual letter so you can see it whenever you want c:.
      I hope you're having a lot of fun, I'm very proud of you for staying off your phone for the weekend. I already miss you a lot. 
      I feel very weird without you.</p>
    <p>I've been okay so far though, I smoked on 4/20 because it was 4/20 haha.
      I know I can be reckless and all, but that's why you're a perfect fit for me.
      I'm missing my other half and I feel myself falling too far on one end. 
      I think I have developed separation anxiety lol. Maybe you're laughing at this letter.
      I wish I could hear you laugh right now. I wanna sleep on your big ass legs again so bad you drive me crazy. Anyway,
      I just wanted to send you something so you don't forget all about me. I hope you're making a lot of friends and playing your guitar so pretty.
      I wanna picnic when you come back. Your sister just told me you can't have any electronics so I don't even know if this letter is gonna get to you in time.
      But I'll send it to your supervisors on email jajajjajajajaja. Please take care and relax, nobody deserves a break from school and work like you do right now.
      I will always be your biggest fangirl, I can't help but fantasize about you when you're not around.
      <p>I love you a lot.
      Come back to me soon.</p>
      <p> PS: my bed's kinda losing your smell, I need you to come lay on it a little more c;</p>
